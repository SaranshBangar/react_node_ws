# React_Node_WS

**React_Node_WS** is a fullstack web development project that combines Next.js, Node.js and Express. This project serves as a workspace to explore the core principles of fullstack development, including, an express server, server-side rendering, and modern front-end architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend** : Next.js
- **Backend** : Node.js, Express.js
- **Styling** : Tailwind CSS
- **Database** : MySQL
- **Language** : JavaScript

## Project Setup

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaranshBangar/react_node_ws.git
cd react_node_ws

npm run dev
```

> **Open another terminal window:**
